# OBB-trains

A simulation of train routes and timetables

This web application was designed in order to incorporate front and back-end elements to create a simulation of an railway operator's route management system.  

The simulation allows for the user to input a route, a first-departure time, a frequency of departure and a destination.  The app relies on the Moment.js website to access the current time and to calculate the time of departure of the next train in a specific route.  It also stores the train route's information in a Firebase database.  On the front-end, the app is designed using the Bootstrap framework to obtain a clean, simple and visually pleasing presentation of the information.  The name and visual theme of the title are inspired by the Austrian railway system OBB.
